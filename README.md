Hello, my name is Ayub Khalif, and I am a 21-year-old RMIT student pursuing a bachelor's degree in Information technology for the fiscal year 2021. I have a variety of hobbies and interests, but the most of them are related to technology, either directly or indirectly. Some fascinating facts about me include the fact that I am an amazing soccer player who won the men's player of the season award this year, and I also have a kitten. 

Interest In IT

I want to earn a degree in information technology because I've always been fascinated by technology. I work in the IT industry, but at a low level, and I'd like to enhance my career in tech with this degree. I've always been fascinated by technology and technical developments, and I've spent many hours watching software professionals share their day-to-day vlogs as well as viewing the code being written When the opportunity arose, the only option was to study at RMIT, which has a long history and a large number of graduate alumni with interesting experiences to tell, and the fact that this topic and university were both available online through OUA made the decision a no-brainer.

	After completing all these tests, I have come to find out what my personality types are, how I see and view the world and how I learn in any type of setting by analysing these results I can be so much better in many aspects of my life if I follow my strong suits and work hands on as the tests recommend. 
	These results show that I am willing to put in the hard yard in a group work setting but my not be as opinionated and would need some vocal to work with also working with people that ok with me demonstrating how difficult tasks are done rather than explaining and vice versa. 
	I would talk to my group members and show them my results and make sure that we are all on the same boat, so our work styles and personalities don’t clash and if they happen to clash work on ways to fix it rather than neglecting it.
